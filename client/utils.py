# web_service_get
#
# When calling servers on a network, calls can randomly fail. 
# The better approach is to repeat at least N times (typically 
# N=3), and then give up after N tries.
#
def web_service_get(url):
  """
  Submits a GET request to a web service at most 3 times, since 
  web services can fail to respond e.g. to heavy user or internet 
  traffic. If the web service responds with status code 200, 400 
  or 500, we consider this a valid response and return the response.
  Otherwise we try again, at most 3 times. After 3 attempts the 
  function returns with the last response.
  
  Parameters
  ----------
  url: url for calling the web service
  
  Returns
  -------
